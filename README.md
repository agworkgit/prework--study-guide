# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation in creating this guide was to have the infomation I learned structured on a website for easy recall.
- I built this project while learning the tools needed to make it happen.
- This solves the problem of having to google for each topic covered.
- I learned how to structure content with HTML, how to style it with CSS, how to create version control through GitHub so that if something breaks I can go back to an older version and how to add interactivity using JavaScript.
